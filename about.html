Weighing in at 16st 10pounds at my first consultation, Gavin set me up with my first diet plan. Delicious healthy meals and an exercise regime that built week on week, and most importantly gave me the constant motivation for me to keep ongoing and I haven't looked back since. Now weighing in at 13st, I'm at the fittest and healthiest I have ever been. Thanks Gavin.</p>
