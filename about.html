Food plans and workout programs are always tailored to specific needs and requests. His approach to fitness and well-being is very motivating, but more importantly - he is very relatable and meets you at your current fitness level without any judgment. Personal detail is given to all aspects of his work. It is a 10 out of 10 from me.</p>

Weighing in at 16st 10pounds at my first consultation, Gavin set me up with my first diet plan. Delicious healthy meals and an exercise regime that built week on week, and most importantly gave me the constant motivation for me to keep ongoing and I haven't looked back since. Now weighing in at 13st, I'm at the fittest and healthiest I have ever been. Thanks Gavin.</p>
